                <h3>Magnitude of the Problem</h3>
                <p>Food waste in Sub-Saharan Africa is a pressing issue, exacerbated by rapid population growth. Households contribute significantly to this problem, with 96% reporting weekly food waste. Institutions and produce markets also contribute, generating substantial amounts of waste daily.</p>
                <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Household waste:</strong> Ugandan households generate an average of 680 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional waste:</strong> Institutions such as schools and restaurants contribute 80 tons daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Produce market waste:</strong> Produce markets generate 8 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="area">
                <h3>Who is Affected?</h3>
                <p>Sub-Saharan Africa faces a stark contrast between hunger and food waste. Despite a large hungry population, significant amounts of food are lost at various stages of the supply chain. Smallholder farmers, urban consumers, and vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected. Addressing this issue requires improvements in agricultural practices, food distribution, consumer education, and policy.</p>

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p><strong>FreshKeep</strong> started with a mission to tackle food waste in Uganda. We saw how much food spoils before it can be used, causing environmental and economic issues. Our smart storage system keeps produce fresh longer by monitoring humidity, temperature, and using natural preservatives. By combining innovative tech with community efforts, we're making a real difference.</p>

    <h3>Our Progress</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> We explored food waste problems and designed FreshKeep to meet the needs of local farmers and households.</li>
        <li><strong>Building a Team:</strong> Experts from agriculture, tech, and health came together to shape our project.</li>
        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> We set clear goals and strategies, focusing on sustainability and community impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> We're working on a user-friendly design that fits local needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
    <p>FreshKeep is still developing, but we've made great strides. Next, we’ll finalize the prototype and bring our idea to life, helping reduce food waste and support communities in Uganda.</p>
