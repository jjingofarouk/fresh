            <h2>The Food Waste Crisis</h2>
            <div class="content-area">
                <p>Food waste in <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> is a critical issue, exacerbated by rapid population growth. Households play a significant role, with <strong>96%</strong> reporting weekly food waste. Beyond homes, <strong>institutions</strong> and <strong>markets</strong> also contribute, discarding large quantities of food daily.</p>
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Household waste:</strong> Ugandan households generate an average of 680 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional waste:</strong> Schools and restaurants contribute 80 tons daily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market waste:</strong> Produce markets generate 8 tons of food waste daily.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Who is Affected?</h3>
                <p>Sub-Saharan Africa faces a stark contrast between hunger and food waste. Despite a large hungry population, significant amounts of food are lost throughout the supply chain. Smallholder farmers, urban consumers, and vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected. Addressing this issue requires improvements in agricultural practices, food distribution, consumer education, and policy.</p>

                <p><strong>FreshKeep</strong> began with a mission to tackle food waste in Uganda. We saw how much food spoils before it can be used, causing environmental and economic harm. We developed FreshKeep as a way to extend the life of food, reduce waste, and support local communities. Over time, our solution evolved to be more energy-efficient, portable, and user-friendly. Today, FreshKeep is making a difference in the fight against food waste and contributing to a sustainable future.</p>
